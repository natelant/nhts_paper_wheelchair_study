Cities across the world are concerned with understanding and forecasting the impacts of modern mobility systems. Systems such as ridehailing via Transportation Network Companies (TNC), flexible route transit systems, on-demand carpool services, autonomous vehicles, and others promise to greatly improve, or at least transform, urban mobility throughout the 21st century. Ideally, these modern systems of transporation are accessible to all users, but individuals who are physically disabled have reported difficulties using many of these systems [@Bascom2017]. 

Riders with disabilities, like the general public, want to have choices. For example, bus service may 
work well for a disabled person’s trips to work and school, but they may want to use a taxi or TNC on an 
evening after a movie. Riders also want to choose whether to pay less by sharing a ride or to spend more 
to go directly to their destination [@Francisco2019].

According to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), an estimated 25.5 million Americans have disabilities that make traveling outside the home difficult. They accounted for 8.5 percent of the population age 5 and older in 2017. An estimated 13.4 million of these Americans—more than half—are adults age 18 to 64, the age group with typically high labor force participation [@Brumbaugh2018]. An estimated 4.3 million Americans use some kind of wheelchair (manual, mechanical or an electric scooter).

In order for individuals to obtain employment, goods and services, healthcare, education, and interact socially, access to transportation is critical (Cassas, 2007; Preston and Raje, 2008) For example, a lack of access to transportation not only limits access to employment opportunities, but can also make it more difficult to find employment by limiting access to employment center and interview locations (Kenyon et al., 2002; Department of Environment Transport and the Regions, 2000). Similarly, healthcare and education are often not equally distributed in a community, making access difficult for individuals who do not live near these services (Martens, 2012)
