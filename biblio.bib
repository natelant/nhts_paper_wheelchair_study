abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine individuals with disabilities' social and community participation in relation to their access to transportation. A self-administered online questionnaire was disseminated to individuals with disabilities throughout the United States. Individuals were found to use private vehicles less often and public transportation more often than previous studies have shown. Individuals with increasingly significant disabilities were more likely to face transportation-related exclusion. Almost half of the participants had to cancel an appointment because of a transportation-related conflict. The majority of participants felt that the level of access to transportation hindered their social life.},

@book{Ellis2016,
abstract = {The synthesis explores just how public transportation agencies are using taxis to serve people with disabilities and older adults, and identifies the advantages as well as the challenges of that use. In addition, the experiences of transit agencies participating in the synthesis provide “lessons learned” that can be shared with other agencies that are considering taxis as a resource so those agencies can plan wisely. Thirty-nine of 45 transit agencies in the representative sample responded, a response rate of 87{\%}. Additional information is offered in a literature review and case examples.},
